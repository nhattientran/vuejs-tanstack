# Design System Implementation

## From Design Specs

When implementing pages from design specs:
1. Always reference MASTER.md for the correct color scheme (green primary, not orange/red)
2. Verify all i18n keys exist for Vietnamese text before marking complete
3. Use MasterLayout wrapper consistently
4. Test both light and dark mode themes
