# Debugging

## UI Bug Fixes

When fixing UI bugs, start with the simplest visual inspection approach:
1. Take a screenshot or use browser DevTools
2. Inspect element styles directly
3. Only use Puppeteer/Playwright for automated testing if regression testing is needed

Avoid over-engineering with browser automation for simple visual feedback.
